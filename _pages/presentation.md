Here are the slides and video recording of my most recent talk at the Graduate Algebra and Representation Theory Seminar (GARTS) at Rutgers University

* [An Introduction to Quantum Groups and their Representation Theory:
\\(U_{q}(\mathfrak{sl}_{2})\\)](https://almosttrivial.github.io/files/Quantum_sl2_GARTS.pdf)

In the Spring of 2020 I was in a Maple programming course taught by Prof. Zeilberger, and one day none other than Neil Sloane gave a talk on some interesting sequences he and a colleague of his had been considering. He tasked the class with working on analyzing the sequences, and he was quite interested with the plots I produced; you can find them [here](https://oeis.org/A331452) on the OEIS!
