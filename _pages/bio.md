In my first two years of doctoral studies at Rutgers University I learned about the Representation Theory of Lie Algebras as presented in HUMPHREYS, then the Representation Theory of Kac-Moody algebras predominantly through CARTER, and most recently Tensor Categories and the Representation Theory of Quantum Groups, the former through ETINGOF and the latter from JANTZEN. My adviser has also introduced me to other related topics e.g. Lie superalgebras and Deligne categories. The latest topic I was exploring was the connection of Quantum Groups to Knot Theory through the works of Reshetikhin and Turaev. Eventually, I came across a book by the latter mathematician and have been focusing on TQFT.

However, I do not want to disregard all of the other cool topics I like and want to learn more about; this is what the BLOG POSTS are dedicated to. There I will essentially be uploading my notes as I learn TQFT, but also thoughts and exposes of other things, which are particularly Category Theoretic in nature. I also enjoy preparing presentations as a way to learn a topic, so in the PRESENTATIONS tab above you will find PDFs of presentations I have given and plan on giving. The CV tab is just that, while the MATH ART tab contains several diagrams and figures which I find pleasant.
