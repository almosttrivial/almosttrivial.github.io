In my first two years of doctoral studies at Rutgers University I learned about the Representation Theory of Lie Algebras as presented in [Humphreys](https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_Lie_Algebras_and_Represe.html?id=gCUlAQAAIAAJ), then the Representation Theory of Kac-Moody algebras predominantly through [Carter](https://books.google.com/books/about/Lie_Algebras_of_Finite_and_Affine_Type.html?id=gv2Xf8VVi2MC), and most recently Tensor Categories and the Representation Theory of Quantum Groups, the former through [Etingof](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Tensor_Categories/NwM-CgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0) and the latter from [Jantzen](https://books.google.com/books/about/Lectures_on_Quantum_Groups.html?id=uOGqPjjVt0AC). My adviser has also introduced me to other related topics e.g. Lie superalgebras and Deligne categories. The latest topic I was exploring was the connection of Quantum Groups to Knot Theory through the works of Reshetikhin and Turaev. Eventually, I came across a [book](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Quantum_Invariants_of_Knots_and_3_Manifo/HsfJDQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0) by the latter mathematician and have been focusing on TQFT.

However, I do not want to disregard all of the other cool topics I like and want to learn more about; this is what the [blog posts](https://almosttrivial.github.io/year-archive/) are dedicated to. There I will essentially be uploading my notes as I learn TQFT, but also thoughts and exposes of other things. The [Resources](https://almosttrivial.github.io/resources/) tab contains a list of books that I have read or at least come across and intend on reading, which the interested visitor might find fun to read.
