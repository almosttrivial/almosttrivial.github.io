* [Lie Algebras and their Representation Theory notes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sbxLuVlFT-y8O5hIGBm1N-VQB2gKD34S/view?usp=sharing) . These are notes essentially following Humphreys book (for which the notes are named after), but after a couple of years of having read the book and coming back to it with some other perspectives I have developed since my first read through. 

  # -My primary interests these days are in the applications of quantum groups and their representation theory, which mimics the representation theory of their classical counterparts when the quantum parameter is not a root of unity. Thus, some of the notes will have an emphasis on more representation theoretic material, but also discussing certain
