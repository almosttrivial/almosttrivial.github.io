* This [book](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387900537) by Humphreys was my introduction to Lie algebras and their representation theory. It is also quite popular in the community of representation theorists whose work even remotely pertains to Lie algebras. What more can I say besides give it a chance? You will not be disappointed.

* This [second book](https://books.google.com/books/about/Reflection_Groups_and_Coxeter_Groups.html?id=ODfjmOeNLMUC) by Humphreys is also a great read. I only started reading it near the beginning of August of 2020, but I wish I had read it concurrently with the other book. This book is very thorough and hence, cited quite often even decades after its publication.

* This [book](https://books.google.com/books/about/Lie_Algebras_of_Finite_and_Affine_Type.html?id=gv2Xf8VVi2MC) by Carter was my introduction to Kac-Moody algebras. Well, my first intro was actually through a book by Kac, but it was rather difficult to read and had an awkward pacing. Thankfully, Carter's book is very concise and presents all of the details in a comfortable pace and logical order. Since reading through it, there are certainly other nice treatments of Affine Lie algebras, but Carter's book will always be a staple in my library.

* This [book](https://books.google.com/books/about/Lectures_on_Quantum_Groups.html?id=uOGqPjjVt0AC) by Jantzen was my introduction to Quantum Groups, or rather Quantized Universal Enveloping Algebras. His proofs are very clear and the logic is natural, which I found especially encouraging since this was my first exposure to the topic. Others like Jimbo, Drinfeld, and Lusztig come to mind wen thinking of Quantum Groups. However, Janzten's treatment is certainly more to the point.
