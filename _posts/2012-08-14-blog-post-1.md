I came across Homological Algebra like I think most do, which is as Simplicial Homology in Hatcher's Algebraic Topology. This becomes axiomatized in Hatcher a few sections later, but it certainly does not present homology in its full generality. Namely, in what types of categories can we construct a homology theory? I will address this in this blog post by exploring the progression of the structure on a category required to formulate a Homology Theory. One of the best resources on the field of Homological Algebra is a text by WEIBEL, which I will refer to as necessary.
