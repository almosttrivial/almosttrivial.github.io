I came across Homological Algebra like I think most do, which is as Simplicial Homology in Hatcher's Algebraic Topology. This becomes axiomatized in Hatcher a few sections later, but it certainly does not present homology in its full generality. Namely, in what types of categories can we construct a homology theory? I will address this in this blog post by exploring the progression of the structure on a category required to formulate a Homology Theory. One of the best resources on the field of Homological Algebra is a text by WEIBEL, which I will refer to as necessary.

(Ab-)Enriched Categories
======

Most working mathematicians assume their categories are such that the collection of morphisms between objects forms a set. However, consider \\(\textbf{Vect}_{k}\\), the category whose objects are \\(k\\)-vector spaces and morphisms are \\(k\\)-linear maps. Then one may in fact imbue add two maps \\(\text{Hom}_{\textbf{Vect}_{k}}(V,W)\\) with the structure of a \\(k\\)-vector space by the natural pointwise addition and scalar multiplication. This holds more generally in the category \\(R-\text{mod}\\) of left \\(R\\)-modules with \\(R\\)-linear maps where \\(R\\) is some ring.
