I discussed that any finite-dimensional Lie algebra admits a decomposition into a semi-direct product of a semisimple Lie subalgebra and a solvable ideal ([Levi decomposition](https://almosttrivial.github.io/posts/Levi-Decomposition/)). Thus, it is reasonable to work with semisimple Lie algebras, and indeed they happen to have some [nice properties](). This blog post explores one of the crucial properties of a complex finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra.

Recall that a [representation](https://almosttrivial.github.io/posts/Basics-Of-Lie-Algebras/) of a Lie algebra \\(\mathfrak{g}\\) is a Lie algebra homomorphism \\(\phi:\mathfrak{g}\to\text{End}(V)\\) for some vector space \\(V\\). Then if \\(\mathfrak{g}\\) is a semisimple Lie algebra, one has the following theorem attributed to Weyl:

**Theorem** Every finite-dimensional representation of \\(\mathfrak{g}\\) is completely reducible.

That is, every \\(\mathfrak{g}\\)-module decomposes into a direct sum of irreducible \\(\mathfrak{g}\\)-modules. Note the similarity with the setting of representations for a finite group.

**Proof**
