* Recall Serre's presentation and classification of simple Lie algebras
* Consider the general definition of g(A)
* Specialize to A a GCM
* Mention classification of GCMs (separate blog post?)
* Mention finites are done, the affines are done but really cool and so much to do there. 
* Shout out to hyperbolic stuff e.g. Carbone's work
* The representation theory of affine is similarly determined as in the finite case
