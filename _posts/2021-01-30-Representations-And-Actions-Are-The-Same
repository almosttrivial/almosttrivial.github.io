In a [previous post](https://almosttrivial.github.io/posts/OnMonoidAndModuleObjects/) I discussed the categorification of monoids by way of the notion of **monoid objects**. These are essentially triples \\((M,\mu,\iota)\\) in a monoidal category, such that the morphisms \\(\mu\\) and \\(\iota\\) satisfied a couple of diagrams. In particular, I listed off some nice examples of monoids e.g., classical monoids, rings, and algebras (in the appropriate monoidal category) are indeed instances of monoid objects. However, given such instances of objects, the first thing that comes to mind in trying to study monoid objects is to categorify how it is that one studies a ring or an algebra.

Well, when one studies rings or algebras, one typically studies modules or representations of these objects (which of course are analogous in the same way rings and algebras are analogous). But what might be less well-known is how one studies monoids. That is, what exactly is the notion of a module for a classical monoid? To this end, I will actually focus on a particular class of monoids to exemplify that one can in fact proceed in two seemingly different ways, but they are in fact all the same. Namely, let us consider how we study groups!

After all, groups are themselves monoids, but they just have the luxury of every element having an inverse. Thinking back to a first semester in algebra, one eventually makes their way to study groups via **group-actions**. If it's been a while since the reader has seen this definition, well recall that a group-action for a group \\(G\\) is a group homomorphism \\(\phi:G\to\text{Aut}(X)\\) where \\(X\\) is a set; this is the compact way of defining a group-action at least. From this, one consider the rich theory of orbits and stabilizers, working toward the powerful class equation. However, sets are not the only thing we can let groups act on.

In particular, while one might not see it in a first semester course of algebra, the notion of module or representation for a group might be familiar to some of the readers. This is analogous to group-actions, in that rather than having \\(G\\) act on a set \\(X\\), we consider \\(G\\) acting on a vector space \\(V\\). Specifically, this too is a group homomorphism like a group-action, but with a different codomain, \\(\varphi:G\to GL(V)\\). Thus, in this sense one can view actions and representations as being the same thing since they are both just homomorphisms. To further this analogy, we will actually construct commutative diagrams that encapsulate the definition of a group-action and representation, but then point out the elephant in the room which asserts why these two notions are very different. This difference will then lead us down the path of enriched categories!

As with the motivation for defining a monoid object, I will formulate the definition of a left-module for a classical monoid in terms of diagrams, and then just replace \\(\times\\) with \\(\otimes\\) and call it a day. Thus, let \\((M,\mu,\iota)\\) be a monoid in the classical sense i.e. a monoid object in \\(\textbf{Set}\\). Then a left \\(M\\)-module is classically a set with a monoid homomorphism \\(\phi: M\to\text{End}\_{\textbf{Set}}(A)\\). In particular, element-wise one has

\begin{align\*}
    \phi(xy)(a) & = \phi(x)(\phi(y)(a))\newline
    \phi(1)(a) & = a
\end{align\*}

for all \\(x,y\in M\\) and \\(a\in A\\). The rigorous reader might have an issue with me using the term "module" or "representation," and instead might say this is a "monoid-action." To them I say, actions and representations are essentialy the same thing, and in fact the notion of module object is precisely the tool in unifying these concepts.

Now, the above equalities are equivalent to the following diagrams being commutative

where \\(\lambda\_{A}\\) is the left unitor as before, and where \\(\Phi: (m,a)\mapsto \phi(m)(a)\\). A subtle point is that \\(M\\) and \\(A\\) are objects of the same category! Indeed, \\((M,\mu,\iota)\\) is a monoid object over \\(\textbf{Set}\\), and \\(A\\) was assumed to simply be a set as well. Thus in the categorification, we will define module objects in the same category as that of the corresponding monoid object. In particular, if \\((M,\mu,\iota)\\) is a monoid object in a monoidal category \\((\mathcal{C},\otimes,\mathbb{1},\alpha,\lambda,\rho)\\), then \\((A,\Phi)\\) is a module object for \\((M,\mu,\iota)\\) if the following diagrams commute

And as we did with monoid objects, one can similarly define the dual notion of comodule objects, and consider the corresponding category of these respective objects with their notion of morphisms. For the latter, the notion of morphism of module objects \\((A,\Phi), (B,\Psi)\\) for a common monoid object \\((M,\mu,\iota)\\) is precisely a morphism \\(f:A\to B\\) such that the following diagram commutes

Upon doing so, one finds that the module objects in the above examples of monoid objects are the classical definition of modules e.g. a module object for a monoid object in \\(R\\)-\\(\textbf{mod}\\) is the usual notion of module for an \\(R\\)-algebra \\(A\\).  

In conclusion, categorification is awesome. Seemingly different objects that are defined and motivated by different circumstances are in a sense categorically the same. Whether it is a ring, an algebra over a field or a ring, or even a monad; these objects have the same categorical structure. Moreover, each of these are typically studied by looking at their notion of modules, but even these are also the same structure categorically. However, I am not saying that the categories for which these monoid objects exist are themselves necessarily the same or similar, beyond being monoidal. For instance, the categories \\(\textbf{Mon}\\) and \\(\textbf{Set}\\) are not \\(\textbf{Ab}\\)-enriched while \\(R\\)-\\(\textbf{mod}\\) is an abelian category.

While I am an advocate of generalizations, they certainly have their shortcomings. For instance, I highly doubt the factorization of finitely generated modules over a PID can be obtained through the lens of these categorical considerations! It would definitely be cool to see what such a categorical statement would be.
